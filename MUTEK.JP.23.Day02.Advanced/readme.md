# Day02.Signaling
The file shared in this Github repository is an ideal file for where we hope to get to within 2 hours of classes.

## Signaling Server IP
The Signaling Client needs to connect to a Signaling Server. The Signaling Server file is shared in that repository. This is designed so that you can run the experiment outside of the workshop context if you wish. However, you will need to setup the network to meet your needs, including specifying Signaling Server IP and ports.
